As I end my studies at Southern New Hampshire University, I have a lot to be thankful for. Creating an ePortfolio is an amazing takeaway which will help showcase my newly formed skills and achievements. The ePortfolio helps promote my strengths in a well-rounded atmosphere and helps me become more employable in the computer science field because I can simply show my employer examples of my work and what I am capable of. This ePorfolio is an honest example of my skills. I still have a long way to go to be considered an expert in my new field, but the ePortfolio is a great example showing my limits and that I have potential to learn and grow. Now that I have the GitHub webpage up and running, I will always be able to add more content at any time. 



### My Code Review

  This is a code review, which I go over in depth the functions of the two projects, The Airgead Banking application and Advanced Querying and Creating Full-Text Indexes. I first start with the Airgead Banking application, going almost line by line explaining what each part of the code does and why I have it. 
  The last part of the code review I go over my assignment Advanced Querying and Creating Full-Text Indexes, again explaining the code and the why behind it. This is a great video which show my understanding of completing a code review and shows my understanding of the code I created. Enjoy!
